Contents are:
 - ~~`png/**/materialicons/48dp/1x/*.png` files from [Google's Material Design Icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons)~~
 - [Templarian's MaterialDesign](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign) ones. These one are `.svg` and have to be converted to `.png` first
 - Icons converted to `.qgf` format too.
 - Helper scripts for the conversion (flatening/cleaning) of the Google design was not added here

NOTE: Black-outline images don't seem to work, keeping them for now but will probably remove them
