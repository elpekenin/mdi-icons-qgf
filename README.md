This repo is only meant as a database of pre-converted icons to ease work with [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)'s Quantum Painter.

All credits to their original authors

Contents are:
 - [Templarian's MaterialDesign](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign) icons. They are `.svg` and have to be converted to `.png` first
 - Icons converted to `.qgf` format too.
 - Helper scripts for these convertions

You can browse the available icons at https://materialdesignicons.com/ (repo may be missing some newer ones, just clone the original repo and use the scripts over it)
